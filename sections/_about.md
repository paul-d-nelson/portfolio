My name is Paul Nelson, and I love telling stories. It's been a part of me since I was five, playing with LEGO and making up stories for my minifigs. Since then, my interests have evolved, but storytelling has remained a constant. I wrote a few books, acted in a few plays, and even helped create a web series with some friends. At some point along that journey, I started using the computer, which I immediately fell in love with.

The web is a perfect combination of several mediums: text, images, video, and audio. This is what drew me to it so many years ago, and what caused me to choose it as a focus area in ASU's Graphic Information Technology program. I have learned a lot about web development over the last few years, but even now I continue to learn new things and improve my workflow. I value elegance and efficiency, and always try to improve these skills each time I start a project.

From June to December 2015 I worked at [Resound Creative](http://resoundcreative.com/) as a web development intern, where I created websites and themes for customers using WordPress, Sass, and PHP. It was a wonderful opportunity, and I gained a lot of real-world experience working on projects and communicating with customers. Some of the websites I worked on can be seen in my [Portfolio](portfolio).
